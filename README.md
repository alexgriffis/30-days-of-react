This repo was written and is maintained by the [Fullstack React](https://fullstackreact.com) team. In the book we cover many more projects like this. We walk through each line of code, explain why it's there and how it works.

If you're looking to learn React, there's no faster way than by spending a few hours with the [Fullstack React book](https://fullstackreact.com).
